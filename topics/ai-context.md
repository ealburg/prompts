# Will AI replace developers

There is no doubt that AI is going to change the landscape of software development.  Models are getting better and better, there are software platforms that allow you to "talk to the ai" and it will generate front end code.  It is amazing.

But what would you think will happen if a seasoned developer gave instructions to these AI models vs a complete noob?  spolier alert... a huge difference.

AI works with a trained model... say with software... and then it works with instructions and resoruces in a "context window".  What goes into the context window matters... years of knowledge experiences, or just guesses...

Imagine jumping to in cab in a different country where you don't speak the language, trying to give detailed instructions of where you want to go, street by street.. without actually know what you are talking about.

Or having a super AI trained on all the surgeries ever done in medicine... would you feel safe having me tell the AI how to remove your apendix or do brain surgey on you?

Context matters....
