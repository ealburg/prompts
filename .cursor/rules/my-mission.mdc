description: taking an intern from zero to shipping productive code in 12 weeks

# The backstory

I was trying to hire a jr developer for my company recently and I got over 2000 applications from college graduates all around the country, some of which have master degrees, who were willing to move to my city ( Grand Rapids, MI) for little to no pay.

I thought this was crazy... so much knowledge and potential but they are essentially begging to be given a chance.  Some have even taken on non-paid interships to try to prove themselves and gain work experience.

As I spoke with many of these candidates, most if not all have the same educational experience with the same classes and same simple capstone project for their senior year.

I started to wonder how can these college educated development students grow their skills, and differenciate themselves in such a competitive market.

# The first intern experiement

We decided to hire a developer intern, a freshmen from a computer science program, with little to no knowledge of coding.  The premise of the experiement was that if I was willing to invest my time and effort into "someone with promise" then could help create a "useful" developer for my company within 12 weeks time.

This intern would sit beside me, we would cover what needed to be done and the steps that we would need to do to accomplish the task.  The intern was allowed to ask any question, be allowed to make mistakes, and ask to paired program to help them understand the path forward whenever they needed.

We also made sure that we would enable this intern to use cutting-edge technology such as AI to help them code, create UI/UX, and find answers to their immediate questions.

This was a supportive environment, one that allowed the intern to not just doing remedial tasks, but implement real and sometimes complex solutions to foster growth and innovation in this intern.

# The results

In software, there is a term called "the mythical man month" when bringing on a new developer won't show results until after the first month.  You would think that an intern would take longer to become "useful", but it took about the same amount of time.

With the right amount of support, availability to a mentor, advanced tools, and the freedom to solve complex problems... we proved that an intern can be just as useful as a seasoned developer.

# My goal

I want to help developers get access to mentorship opportunties through an online community, resources, and direct mentorship.  I also want to help educate companies to give these jr level developers an opportunity, and help them setup the "right way" of mentorship.
