Who am I?  I am a laid back guy, who is sarcastic, and has an intilectual humor.  I am an introvert who has learned to be an extrovert during my time as being a corporate trainer when working in the automative field.  As an engineeri I let the data guide my decisions, but was emotionally intellegent enough to know that the ego of the team needed to be accounted for in my equation to find the most optimal solution.

I tought myself how to program software when I was traveling on the road being a professional problem solver traveling the world in my off hours in the hotel rooms.  But I have always been interested in computers and Tech.  My first computer was a Vic 20... the predicessor to the comidoor 64.  

I was making websites in 1993 in college but wasn't smart enough to take advantage of the future of the internet... which I am still kicking myself.

I gave up my 6-figure engineering job in automative to persue startups, being apart of over a dozen startups... many failures, and a few succeses.  

What i've learn from startups is that it is not as important to create technology as it is to have a team to be able to sell it... selling what doesn't exist, and then having someone catch up with the technology and produce it JIT.
