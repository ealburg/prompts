# prompts

This repository contains all my AI prompts written in markdown format. These prompts are organized and version-controlled for easy access and sharing across different AI tools and platforms.

## Purpose

- Store and organize AI prompts in a centralized location
- Version control prompt iterations and improvements
- Share prompts across different projects and tools
- Maintain a searchable collection of effective prompts

## Structure

Prompts are formatted following the structure used by [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Fabric), an open-source framework for augmenting humans using AI. Each prompt will be organized as:

- Individual markdown files for each prompt pattern
- Clear system instructions and context
- Consistent formatting for easy integration with AI tools
- Modular design that can be chained or used independently

This approach ensures compatibility with various AI frameworks and makes prompts easily reusable across different platforms and use cases.
